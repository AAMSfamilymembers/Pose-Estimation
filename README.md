# Pose-Estimation

Pose estimation of a custom marker

I have designed a blue rectangular-marker with a redand green circle inside it.

STEPS INVOLVED:-

1. Marker segmentation from background.
2. Extracting the corners of the marker.
3. Labelling the corners of the marker corresponding to the world-cordinates
4. Calculation of Rotation and translation using solvePnP
