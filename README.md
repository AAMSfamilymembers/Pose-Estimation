# Pose-Estimation

Pose estimation of a custom marker

I have designed a blue rectangular-marker with a red and green circle inside it.

STEPS INVOLVED:-

1. Marker segmentation from background.
2. Extracting the corners of the marker.
3. Labelling the corners of the marker corresponding to the world-cordinates
4. Calculation of Rotation and translation using solvePnP

# SubTask Involved
To detect hand and count the number of fingers shown 

STEPS INVOLVED:-

1. Hand detection using Haar cascade.
2. Contour of hand and convex hull.
3. Find the Convexity defects.
4. Count the number of fingers with the help of available defects.

This was done in C++, Python programming languages
